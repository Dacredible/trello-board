###Why I start this project

Ran into this quesition during an interview, originally no drag and drop requested, only moving cards through button. After that interview I feels it's a good project to pratice. So I decided to do a Trello mockup project.



The drag and drop feature I used [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd), it's a pretty cool package , the only thing I feel it's missing right now is not have the ability to customize the style of placeholder.
